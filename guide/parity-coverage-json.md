# Parity Coverage JSON

`parity-coverage.json` is a language-neutral attribution format for ecosystems whose native coverage output does not include which test covered which line.

Use it when Clover or Cobertura can prove aggregate file coverage, but you also want `matched-coverage` and `coverage-attribution`.

## Schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "globalPercent": 80,
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/formatCurrency.ts",
      "coveragePercent": 70,
      "totalExecutableLines": 10,
      "lines": [
        {
          "line": 1,
          "coveredBy": ["formatCurrency.test::coversPrimaryBehavior"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | Recommended | Format version. Use `1`. |
| `globalPercent` | Optional | Project-level coverage percentage from `0` to `100`. |
| `files[].path` | Yes | Source path relative to the project root. |
| `files[].coveragePercent` | Recommended | All-test coverage percentage for the file. |
| `files[].totalExecutableLines` | Required for `matched-coverage` | Number of executable lines in the file. |
| `files[].lines[].line` | Yes | Executable line number. |
| `files[].lines[].coveredBy` | Yes | Test names that covered that line. |

## Configuration

```yaml
coverage_xml: [.parity/per-test, parity-coverage.json, coverage-xml, clover.xml, cobertura.xml]

structure:
  - name: "Utilities"
    paths:
      source: "src"
      test: "tests"
    rules:
      - minimum-coverage:
          min: 70
      - matched-coverage:
          min: 40
```

## JavaScript Converter Example

This minimal converter shows the shape a custom tool should produce. Real converters should read attribution from the runner, coverage library, or instrumentation layer available in the project.

```js
import { writeFileSync } from 'node:fs'

const report = {
  version: 1,
  globalPercent: 80,
  files: [
    {
      path: 'src/formatCurrency.ts',
      coveragePercent: 70,
      totalExecutableLines: 10,
      lines: [
        {
          line: 1,
          coveredBy: ['formatCurrency.test::formats_cents']
        },
        {
          line: 2,
          coveredBy: [
            'formatCurrency.test::formats_cents',
            'checkout.integration.test::renders_total'
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

writeFileSync('parity-coverage.json', `${JSON.stringify(report, null, 2)}\n`)
```

Then run:

```bash
parity check --config=parity.yaml --format=json
```
