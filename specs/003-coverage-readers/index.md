## Overview

The Coverage Readers module is responsible for ingesting pre-generated coverage reports and normalizing them into a uniform data structure that downstream rules and the CLI can consume. Parity can either read native coverage artifacts directly or read Parity-native attribution artifacts produced by `parity test`.

Five coverage formats are supported: **Parity per-test reports** (a directory with `index.json` and one normalized report per test), **Parity JSON** (a language-neutral JSON file), **Clover XML** (a single file with per-file statement coverage), **Cobertura XML** (a portable single-file format used by many ecosystems), and **PHPUnit XML** (a directory of per-class XML files with per-line, per-test attribution). The format is detected automatically based on whether the configured path points to a file or to a directory containing `index.json` or `index.xml`. When multiple paths are configured, the first existing match wins.

The data produced by these readers feeds directly into the rules system (S002). Clover and Cobertura XML provide enough data for the `minimum-coverage` rule. Parity per-test reports, Parity JSON, and PHPUnit XML additionally enable `matched-coverage`, `coverage-attribution`, and the `--show-tests` CLI flag (S001) by exposing which specific tests covered each line of each source file.

## User Scenarios

S003-US-001 [P1] As a developer running `parity check`, I want per-file coverage percentages read from my Clover XML report so that the `minimum-coverage` rule can evaluate each source file.

S003-US-002 [P1] As a developer using PHPUnit XML coverage, I want per-test attribution data so that `matched-coverage` can distinguish coverage from the matching test vs. incidental coverage from other tests.

S003-US-003 [P2] As a CI pipeline operator, I want Parity to auto-detect the coverage format from the configured path so that I do not need to specify the format explicitly.

S003-US-004 [P2] As a developer, I want to configure multiple fallback coverage paths so that PHPUnit XML is used when available and Clover XML is used as a fallback.

S003-US-006 [P1] As a developer in a non-PHP ecosystem, I want to use Cobertura XML so that Parity can enforce per-file coverage for JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go, and other projects that commonly emit Cobertura.

S003-US-005 [P1] As a developer, I want clear error messages when coverage files are missing or malformed so that I can diagnose CI pipeline issues quickly.

## Cross-Spec Dependencies

- **Depends on:** S006 (Configuration -- `coverage_xml` path list, `min_coverage_global`)
- **Required by:** S002 (Rules System -- `minimum-coverage`, `matched-coverage`, `coverage-attribution` rules consume the coverage data structures produced here)
- **Required by:** S001 (CLI Commands -- `--show-tests` flag relies on `testsByFile` from any attribution-capable reader)
- **Required by:** S004 (Coverage Linkers -- consumes per-line coverage data for linking)
